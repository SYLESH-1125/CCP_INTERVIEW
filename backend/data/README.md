This folder contains the curated company interview intelligence database.

## 📁 Files

- **`company_profiles.json`** - The main curated database (383 expert-verified companies)
- **`discoveries.json`** - Dynamic storage for companies found by the Agentic Team (19+ autonomously discovered)
- **`DOMAIN_REPORT.md`** - Auto-generated report showing company distribution across 12 domains (run `generate_domain_report.py` to refresh)

## 🆕 How to Add a New Company

1. Search the web for live data.
2. Architect a structured profile.
3. Validate and save it to `discoveries.json`.

### Method 2: Helper Script (Manual)

1. Open `backend/add_company.py`
2. Edit the `NEW_COMPANY` dictionary at the top
3. Run: `python add_company.py`
4. Test: `python test_company_intel.py`

### Method 2: Manual Edit

1. Open `company_profiles.json`
2. Copy the template from `company_template.json`
3. Paste it inside the `"companies"` section
4. Fill in all the details
5. Update `"total_companies"` count in `"meta"` section
6. Save the file
