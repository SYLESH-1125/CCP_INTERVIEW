## 📅 Roadmap & Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
- [x] Set up project structure (`backend/`, `frontend/`).
- [x] Initialize Python virtual environment (`venv`).
- [x] Install backend dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- [x] Initialize React + Vite project.
- [x] Configure Environment Variables (`.env`, `.env.example`).
- [x] Initialize Git repository and push to GitHub.
- [x] Set up `.gitignore` to protect API keys and credentials.

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Backend Development (COMPLETED)
- [x] FastAPI boilerplate with CORS, routing, and middleware.
- [x] Database Schema Design (Users, Sessions, Interviews, Feedback).
- [x] Alembic migration setup and version tracking.
- [x] Gemini 2.0 Flash API integration for question generation.
- [x] JWT Authentication system (signup, login, token refresh).
- [x] PDF resume parsing and ATS score generation.
- [x] Multi-round interview session state management.
- [x] Answer evaluation with Vibe Analysis and STAR scoring.
- [x] 7-Day Learning Roadmap generator for failed rounds.
- [x] Neon PostgreSQL integration (cloud-hosted, serverless).

---

### ✅ Phase 3: The Agentic Intelligence Brain (COMPLETED — v2.1.0 → v2.2.2)
- [x] **Curated Database**: 398 expert-verified company profiles across 12 domains.
- [x] **LangGraph Multi-Agent Team**: Router → Researcher → Auditor → Architect → Critic.
- [x] **Router Node**: Detects company ambiguity, industry, and geographic location.
- [x] **Researcher Node**: Dual-search DuckDuckGo (History + Recent Trends).
- [x] **Auditor Node (The Bouncer)**: Filters noise, validates identity against JD, generates audit log.
- [x] **Architect Node (Llama-3)**: Builds structured interview intelligence profile from audited data.
- [x] **Critic Node (Gemini)**: Final quality gate before saving to `discoveries.json`.
- [x] **Stealth Mode**: Reverse-engineers company DNA from JD if no public data exists.
- [x] **Domain Guard**: Prevents role-forcing on non-tech companies.
- [x] **Geographic Guardrails**: Prevents cross-continental name collisions.
- [x] **Evergreen Perpetual Freshness**: Dynamic year calculation — never needs manual year updates.
- [x] **Confidence Score System**: 0–160 scale with clear Synthetic/Verified/Elite Certified tiers.
- [x] **Memory Integrity**: 98% fuzzy threshold, `discoveries.json` never polluted with synthetic data.
- [x] **Audit Trail**: Every discovery includes an `ACCEPTED/REJECTED` log per source link.
- [x] **Domain Report Generator**: `generate_domain_report.py` script for DB health checks.
- [x] **Generic Article Purge (v2.3)**: Python-level domain blocklist in Researcher strips SEO junk sites before AI sees data.
- [x] **Domain-Aware Round Engine (v2.3)**: `round_config.py` completely rewritten — 12 domains each get correct rounds (Case Study for Finance/Legal, Situational for Healthcare, Portfolio Review for Creative, etc.).
- [x] **Managerial Round for All Domains (v2.3)**: Managerial round now correctly applies to ALL 12 domains at Senior level (was incorrectly restricted to Tech + Business only).
- [x] **402 Company Profiles**: Grown from 398 → 402 via autonomous discovery sessions.

---

### ✅ Phase 4: Frontend Development (COMPLETED — Local)
- [x] React + Vite project setup with component structure.
- [x] Modern landing page, login, and signup pages with premium UI.
- [x] User authentication flow (Login, Signup, JWT token management).
- [x] Home dashboard with company + role selection.
- [x] Live interview simulation chat interface.
- [x] Resume and JD upload functionality.
- [x] Post-round feedback and score display.
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (planned — not yet done).

---

### 🔮 Phase 5: Deployment & Security (NOT STARTED)
- [x] API keys rotated after accidental exposure incident.
- [x] All credentials removed from Git history and secured in `.env`.
- [ ] Backend deployment on Render or AWS Lambda.
- [ ] Frontend deployment on Vercel.
- [ ] Configure production environment variables.
- [ ] End-to-end testing on deployed stack.

### 🚧 Phase 6: Coding Round Intelligence (IN PROGRESS — Next 2-3 Days)
*See full design spec: [`CODING_ROUND_DESIGN.md`](./CODING_ROUND_DESIGN.md)*

- [ ] **Problem Spec Generator**: AI generates a structured JSON coding problem per company context.
- [ ] **AI Dry Run Engine**: Gemini mentally executes user code + explanation without a sandbox.
- [ ] **`POST /interview/coding-submit` endpoint**: Accepts code + explanation, returns Dry Run result.
- [ ] **`POST /interview/coding-log` endpoint**: Saves full interaction snapshot to the Learning Ledger.
- [ ] **Tiered Hint System**: 5-tier progressive nudge engine (Conceptual → Structural → Edge Case → Partial Reveal).
- [ ] **Adinath Pressure Mode**: Turn 6+ challenge — pits user's explanation against their own code.
- [ ] **Veda Verbalization Gate**: Forces plain-English approach statement before coding begins.
- [ ] **Resume Hook Extractor**: Reads resume to identify 2-3 skill "targets" for interrogation.
- [ ] **Whiteboard UI**: Split-pane Code Editor (left) + Explanation textarea (right).
- [ ] **Persona Toggle**: "Simulation Mode (Adinath)" vs. "Mentorship Mode (Veda)" selector.
- [ ] **Post-Round Code Review Report**: Full breakdown of all attempts, hints, score, and AI notes.

---

### 🔮 Phase 7: Intelligence Refinement & Scale (PLANNED)
- [ ] **Cross-Continental Localization**: Different process flows for same company in different regions (e.g., Google US vs. Google India).
- [ ] **Discovery Dashboard**: UI screen to browse the `discoveries.json` database publicly.
- [ ] **Real-time Search Streaming**: Push live ACCEPTED/REJECTED research logs to user's dashboard.
- [ ] **Automatic Memory Pruning**: Script to refresh discoveries older than 6 months.
- [ ] **Expand Curated DB**: Grow from 398 → 500+ companies.
- [ ] **Hiring Decision Report**: Final "You are Hired / Rejected" report after all 5 rounds.
- [ ] **Iterative Difficulty Scaling**: Round 2 is harder if Round 1 score was "Elite."
- [ ] **"Researcher at Work" UI**: Animated loading terminal showing agent activity live.
- [ ] **Critic Agent Hardening**: Tighten prompt to catch more subtle hallucinations.
- [ ] **DuckDuckGo Rate Limit Handling**: Robust retry logic with exponential backoff.

---

### 🌌 Phase 8: Long-Term Vision (FUTURE)
- [ ] **AI-Generated Learning Roadmaps**: Auto-convert feedback into a 7-day personalized study plan.
- [ ] **Video/Voice Integration**: WebRTC-based body language and tone analysis during sessions.
- [ ] **Community Leaderboard**: Global "Google-Level Readiness" scores and LinkedIn sharing.
- [ ] **Multi-Language Support**: Extend beyond English for non-English-first markets.
