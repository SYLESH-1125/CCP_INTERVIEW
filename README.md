## 🌟 The Simulation Philosophy

InterviewAI is not just a "mock interview" tool; it is an **Advanced Intelligent Simulation Entity**. While traditional platforms rely on static question banks, InterviewAI uses a **Dynamic Agentic Loop** to synthesize the reality of the 2025/2026 job market.

### 🎭 The Persona Architecture
We don't just ask questions; we simulate **Human Personalities**:
*   **Adinath (The Primal Sage)**: Simulates the "Foundation First" interviewer. He is cold, direct, and explores the recursive depth of your technical architecture. He tests the "How" and the "Why."
*   **Veda (The Eternal Wisdom)**: Simulates the "Clarity Specialist." She is observant, testing your vision, cultural alignment, and your ability to communicate complex ideas under pressure.

---

## 🚀 Technical Innovation: The "Agentic Edge" (v2.3 — Domain-Aware Round Engine)

What makes this project unique in the industry is its **Three-Tier Intelligence Architecture**, designed to solve the "Knowledge Gap" in AI:

1.  **The Curated Core**: Local access to **402 expert-verified company profiles** across 12 domains for zero-latency, reliable data.
2.  **The Agentic Discovery Loop (LangGraph)**: An autonomous multi-agent team that researches public companies in real-time.
    *   **Dynamic Domain Intelligence**: Automatically prevents "Role Forcing" (e.g., won't force LeetCode questions on a legal or clinical role).
    *   **Geographic Guardrails**: Prevents acronym collisions (e.g., identifying **MOC Cancer Care India** vs **Moffitt USA**) by localized search auditing.
    *   **Generic Article Purge**: Python-level domain blocklist strips SEO junk (datacamp, guru99, intellipaat, etc.) before the AI ever sees the data.
3.  **Stealth Mode & Synthetic Fallback**: A world-first feature that **Reverse-Engineers company DNA** from a Job Description. If a company is in "Stealth Mode" (non-public), the AI synthesizes a high-fidelity interview based on industry-standard benchmarking.
4.  **Domain-Aware Round Engine (v2.3)**: Each of the 12 career domains gets its own interview structure — Finance gets Case Study rounds, Healthcare gets Situational/Clinical rounds, Creative gets Portfolio Review. No more forcing tech candidates' rounds onto Accounting or Legal applicants.
5.  **Crowdsourced Self-Learning Memory (v2.4)**: The system now learns from its users. The **Stealth Registry** implements a "Witness vs Expert" consensus logic. It builds high-fidelity profiles for private startups by aggregating data from persistent "Strugglers" (Structural Roadmap) and Top-Performers (Success Criteria).

### 🛡️ Confidence Score Guide
The system now provides transparency on how it "trusts" the discovered intelligence:

| Score | Status | Description | Reliability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0 - 20** | **Synthetic** | No public info found. AI "guesstimates" based strictly on the Industry & JD. | ⚠️ Experimental |
| **85** | **Verified** | Sufficient public sources found. Identity is verified. | ✅ High |
| **100 - 160** | **Elite Certified** | Extreme certainty. Matched Location, Industry, and found Direct Interview Questions. | 🏆 Production Grade |
